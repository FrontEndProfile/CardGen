Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    The generateCards() function is defined to create HTML/CSS card blocks on button click.

    The function gets a reference to the card container element using the getElementById() method.

    An array of card data objects is defined. Each card object has a title, content, and color property.

    The forEach() method is used to loop through the card data array.

    For each card object, the function creates the card elements using document.createElement().

    The card title and content are set using the innerText property.

    The card styles are applied using the backgroundColor property and the classList.add() method to add the "card" class for CSS styling.

    The card elements are appended to the card container using the appendChild() method.
    
    When the button is clicked, the generateCards() function is called to generate the HTML/CSS card blocks.
